The job failed due to a missing download info error for the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action. This error indicates that the runner was unable to fetch the necessary action files.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure that the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action is correctly specified in your workflow file.
2. Verify that the action syntax and version are correct.
3. Check for any network or permission issues that might prevent the action from being downloaded.

Let's review the relevant part of your workflow file to identify any potential issues. I'll fetch the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file for further inspection.The error in your workflow is due to a missing download info for the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action. However, the workflow file you provided does not reference `actions/upload-artifact@v3`. Instead, it references `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1`.

Here's a suggestion to fix the issue:

1. Ensure that you are using the correct action for uploading artifacts. It seems you may need to use `actions/upload-artifact@v3` instead of `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1`.

Update the `Upload artifact` step in your workflow to use `actions/upload-artifact@v3`:

```yaml
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: build-artifact
    path: './dist'
```

2. Make sure to add the corresponding `Download artifact` step in the `deploy` job to download the artifact before deploying:

```yaml
- name: Download artifact
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: build-artifact
```

Here is the updated workflow file:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

    steps:

          # Make sure the GitHubPagesApp is used
          echo "console.log('Building for GitHub Pages');" >> client/src/main.tsx
      
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        env:

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifact
          path: './dist'

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Download artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifact

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1
```

Please update your workflow file with the above changes and try running the workflow again. This should fix the missing download info error.
