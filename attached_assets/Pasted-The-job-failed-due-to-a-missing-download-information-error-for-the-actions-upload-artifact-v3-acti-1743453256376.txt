The job failed due to a missing download information error for the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action. Here's how to resolve this issue:

1. **Check the Workflow Configuration**:
   Make sure that the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action is correctly specified in your workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

2. **Update the Workflow File**:
   Ensure that the `with` and `name` parameters are correctly set for the `upload-artifact` action.

Here's an example of how your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file should look:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: build/

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: build/

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build
```

Make sure to adjust the `node-version`, artifact `name`, and `path` as per your project requirements.

3. **Check for Missing Secrets**:
   Ensure that any secrets referenced in your workflow (e.g., `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`) are correctly set up in your repository settings.

By updating the configuration as shown and ensuring all referenced secrets are in place, the missing download information error should be resolved.
